    <p>Team Trees is a collaborative initiative started by MrBeast, a popular YouTuber, along with Mark Rober, and the Arbor Day Foundation. The project aims to plant 20 million trees by 2020 to combat climate change and deforestation.</p>
    <img src="/photos/TT-MrB.jpeg" alt="Team Trees Image" class="left-image">

    <p>The idea for Team Trees originated when MrBeast hit a milestone of reaching 20 million subscribers on YouTube. To celebrate, he decided to plant 20 million trees. He collaborated with Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer, and the Arbor Day Foundation to make this ambitious goal a reality.</p>
    
    <p>Each dollar donated to Team Trees results in one tree being planted. Donations are made directly to the Arbor Day Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees and promoting environmental conservation.</p>
    
    <p>The project gained widespread attention on social media platforms, with thousands of people and organizations joining the cause. Celebrities, YouTubers, and companies also pledged their support, contributing to the success of the initiative.</p>
