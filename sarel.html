    <p>Sar-El is an organization that has been the lifeblood of support for Israel for
        countless years, bringing thousands of volunteers from across the world to assist the
        IDF. It's our mission to provide essential aid in times of need, and today, that need is
        greater than ever.</p>
        <p>Since the 7th of October, Sar-El has been on the ground, working tirelessly with
        thousands of volunteers who have been lending a helping hand in every conceivable
        way. These dedicated individuals have been actively involved in the critical tasks of
        checking, sorting, and packing vital medical supplies, preparing combat meals,
        assembling ceramic vests, and even deploying a team of doctors who joined combat
        units in the field.</p>

        <p>As the war persists, and the fighting intensifies, the needs of the IDF continue to
        grow. We are grateful for the overwhelming response from those who have signed up
        to help. However, this is just the beginning. New needs arise daily, and we appreciate
        your patience as we work to match volunteers with urgent tasks. Rest assured, we are
        doing our best to accommodate everyone, and your support means the world to us.
        Thank you for being a part of this incredible community and for your invaluable
        contributions. Together, we are making a meaningful difference.</p>
        <P>Please, consider donating to Sar-El and join our community in this crucial mission.
        Your support is a lifeline to our nation, ensuring that we remain strong, secure, and united</p>
